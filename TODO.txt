    https://github.com/rusqlite/rusqlite
Maybe I will use https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel instead
https://docs.rs/diesel/latest/diesel/prelude/struct.SqliteConnection.html

encrypt /report req and route
encrypt /admin/remove_license req and route

at the end, just clean and publish securo as a lib
